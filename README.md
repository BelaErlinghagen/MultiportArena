# MultiportArena

This is the GitHub repository for the Multiport-Arena, a behavioral setup that consists of an OpenField Arena and fitted inlets to turn the OpenField Arena into a Y-Maze.
The software and the hardware allow flexible control over 16 lickports, which consist of a Lick-O-Meter (i.e. capacitive sensor), an LED and a peristaltic pump.

The Setup was built and tested by Bela Erlinghagen, in close cooperation with the iBehave/Cadre (https://github.com/iBehave-CADRE) team.
